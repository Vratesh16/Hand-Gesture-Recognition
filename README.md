# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Project For The Deaf And Blind People
# PROJECT IDEA
Communication is the major problem faced by deaf and dumb people to convey their thought, ideas with other deaf and dumb people and with other normal people. People who are not 
suffered from deaf and dumb can absorb new information and knowledge through the daily activities, conversations and language that is spoken around them. But the people who are 
suffered from deaf and dumb problem have not that luxury. The main aim of this project is to provide voice to the people who are not able to speak. In this project sign language is converted 
into speech or voice using flex sensors, and Arduino IDE, Bluetooth module.

# METHODOLOGY
• The gloves contain flex sensors which are the main sensors for this product.They 
are devices which can show variable resistance based on various bend angles
• The sensors are connected in a voltage divider circuit such that the resulting 
voltage is sent to one analog port of the micro-controller. The glove is mounted 
with 5 flex sensors, each on one finger of the glove.
• The American sign language also contains letters which involve wrist movements 
while trying to communicate. An accelerometer sensor supports the microcontroller to sense the gestures. The microcontroller will map these analog 
current signals and accelerometer values to codes corresponding to each gesture.
